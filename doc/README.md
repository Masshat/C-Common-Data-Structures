LibCDS
=============

##Objective
LibCDS implements several kinds of classic containers by C. It offers uniform APIs for convenient container interaction.

##Container Category
+ Tree  
  + SimpleTree -- The basic binary search tree.  
  + BalancedTree -- The balanced binary search tree implemented with red black tree.  
+ List
  + DoublyLinkedList -- The bi-directional linked list.
+ Array
  + Vector -- The dynamically growable array. 
+ Map
  + OrderedMap -- The key-value pair container leveraging balanced binary search tree.   
+ Heap
  + BinaryHeap -- The basic ordered heap.
  + BinomailHeap -- The advanced ordered heap.
+ Queue
  + PriorityQueue -- The priority queue leveraging ordered heap.
