LibCDS
=============

##Objective
LibCDS implements several kinds of classic containers by C. It offers uniform APIs for convenient container interaction.

##Container Category
+ Tree
  + BinaryTree -- The basic binary search tree.
  + RedBlackTree -- The balanced binary search tree.
+ List
  + LinkedList -- The doubly linked list.
+ Array
  + Vector -- The dynamically growable array.
+ Map
  + TreeMap -- The ordered map to store key value pairs implemented with balanced tree.
  + HashMap -- The unordered map to store key value pairs implemented with hash table.
+ Heap
  + BinaryHeap -- The binary heap implemented with vector.
+ Queue
  + PriorityQueue -- The priority queue implemented with binary heap.
