LibCDS implements several kinds of classic containers by C. It offers uniform APIs for convenient container interaction.

##Container Category

  + SimpleTree -- The basic binary search tree.
  + BalancedTree -- The balanced binary search tree implemented with red black tree.
+ List
  + DLinkedList -- The doubly linked list.
+ Array
  + Vector -- The dynamically growable array.
+ Map
  + OrderedMap -- The ordered map to store key value pairs.
+ Heap
  + BinaryHeap -- The basic ordered heap.
  + BinomailHeap -- The advanced ordered heap.
+ Queue
  + PriorityQueue -- The priority queue leveraging ordered heap.
