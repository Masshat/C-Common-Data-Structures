##Introduction
Though STL is convenient, the know-how is more valuable.   

This project implements some classic data structures using C.   
It is not only a memo but also a verification for some advanced   
or theoretical structures.    

##Usage
### 1. Source Building

#### 1.1 Source Tree

#### 1.2 Building Entire Source
